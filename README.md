# image_classification
My project is an image classification system that uses Haar cascades to detect and recognize objects in images. 
Haar cascades are a popular machine learning technique used for object detection, which involves identifying specific patterns or features in an image. 
In my project, i have trained a Haar cascade classifier on a specific set of features related to the object you want to recognize.

The first step in my project is to gather a dataset of images of the object you want to recognize. 
This dataset is used to train the Haar cascade classifier. 
The classifier then creates a model of the object's features, which it uses to recognize the object in new images.

To classify an image, the classifier scans the image for regions that match the object's features. 
These regions are then further analyzed to determine whether they are indeed the object you are looking for. 
If the classifier determines that the object is present in the image, it returns a positive result along with the object's location in the image.

Your image classification project has many potential applications, such as in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and security systems. 
By using Haar cascades for object detection, you have created a powerful and efficient system for recognizing objects in images, opening up new possibilities for real-world applications.
